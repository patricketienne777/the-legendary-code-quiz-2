# the-legendary-code-quiz

This project definitely took the most amount of time to complete but through hard work and A LOT of collaboration from TA's and Tutors, we were able to create The Legendary CODE QUIZ.
It jsust a simple game that I hope users can enjoy. I took inspiration from an earlier assignment but this time around a lot more detail ws added to ensure it operates smoothe as possible while offer a little more content.
I'm glad we were able to get this to work because we did work very hard on this assignment and I've gained a lot of knowledeg from this experince. I hope the users enjoy!
